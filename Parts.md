# Obtaining Parts and Tools
The products used in this episode are listed below along with at least one source link.

Hopefully you have much of the items on this list already. If you try to purchase everything the cost will be very high. I include the complete list of items I use but I also show ways to get around not having some of these items.

# Parts List and Source
## All Episodes
### Tools
There are a couple of tools that are necessary. A pair of side/diagonal cutters, a pair of wire strippers and a pair of needle-nose pliers. Optionally you may need a soldering iron. I highly recommend a good one, but there are so many to choose from. Below are links to recommended products but you can find suitable alternatives if you like.

* [Flush diagonal cutters](https://www.adafruit.com/product/527)
* [Wire Strippers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/527)
* [Simple pliers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/527)
* [Digital Genuine Hakko FX-888D](https://www.adafruit.com/product/527)

### Large Solderless Breadboard
The large board I am using was purchased from Adafruit ([https://www.adafruit.com/product/443](https://www.adafruit.com/product/443)). If you do not want to purchase this board, or you already have some breadboards, you can just take three breadboards and lock them together. Good quality boards can be purchased from Amazon as well ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FY9LQJF](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FY9LQJF)).

### Hook-up Wire Spool Set
It is nice to have a set of hook-up wire suitable for a breadboard. In the videos I cut most of the wires to length to keep the board neat and clean. 

This is solid core wire (22AWG Solid Core - 6 x 25 ft) and can be purchased from Adafruit ([https://www.adafruit.com/product/131](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1311)1), or from Amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4ZRPEY](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4ZRPEY)).

### Jumper Wires
In addition to cutting wires to length, it is useful to have a few pre-made jumper wires. These wll come in handy for working with the Uno to program the chip or to connect the power supply.

## Episode 1
No parts needed for this episode.
## Episode 2
### Adjustable Power Supply
I am using a bench top adjustable power supply for to power my mainboard through most of the episodes. There are many varieties of these at a range of prices. The power supply I am using in the videos is linked below.

### Arduino Uno
An AVR programmer is required to program the ATMEGA1284P and to load a bootloader. It is much easier to use an Arduino. The simplest board to use for this is the Uno but any 5V Arduino board will work.

### ATMEGA1284P
I ordered this directly from Microchip. The shipping was low, and it came in a few days. I recommend ordering at least 2 since these are only a few dollars.

### Clock Crystal
The ATMEGA1284P will be run using a 16Mhz crystal. The datasheet also calls for two 20pF capacitors. These three parts can be purchased from Adafruit in a kit.

### Breadboard Compatible Tactile Push Button
Adafruit sells a pack of these buttons that can be pressed into the breadboard. This package includes snap on buttons that make it easy to use the switch.

### 6-pin AVR ISP Breadboard Adapter
These are not required but make programming the ATMEGA1284 bootloader a little easier (and they help make the wiring easier). I recommend ordering two of these.

[https://www.adafruit.com/product/1465](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1465)

### 6-pin Socket/Socket IDC cable - 6"
This is the companion cable to the AVR ISP breadboard adapter above.

### Breadboard-friendly SPDT Slide Switch
This is optional, but this slide switch can be added to the breadboard as a power switch.

[https://www.adafruit.com/product/805](https://www.adafruit.com/product/805)

### Mini Digital DC Voltmeter
I use these to monitor the voltage on the breadboard. They are also handy to measure the output of the MOSFETs.

### Resistors
Resistors can be purchased up from just about anywhere. Either purchase them by size or get a variety container from Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BNDL6DS).

**Sizes Needed:**
220 Ω, 10K Ω

### Capacitors
Capacitors can be purchased from just about anywhere. Either purchase them by size or get a variety container from Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BNDL6DS).

Electrolytic: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TWCT2ZB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TWCT2ZB)

**Sizes needed:**
10 µF, 47 µF, 100 µF

**Sizes needed:**
0.1 µF, 20 pF (if you purchase the crystal without them)

### 1N4001 Diode
A few of these are needed. They can be purchased in a pack of 10 from Adafruit.

[https://www.adafruit.com/product/755](https://www.adafruit.com/product/755)

### LEDs
Multiple LEDs in a variety of colors are used. It does not matter if you use the 3mm or 5mm size. I recommend at least three colors, red, green and blue. LEDs can be purchased on varitey packs or by color.

* [Diffused 5mm LED Pack - 5 LEDs each in 5 Colors - 25 Pack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4203)
* [Super Bright Red 5mm LED (25 pack)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/297)
